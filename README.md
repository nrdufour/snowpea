# SnowPea

Managing raspberry pi (3 & 4) via nixos flakes.
(Maybe, I will add Orange Pi 5 plus to it if doable...)

The goals are:

+ produce a generic sdcard image to be able to properly boot
+ produce any sdcard image that would be dedicated to a give purpose
+ help with deploy remotely (via deploy-rs maybe)

Thanks for the inspiration coming from <https://github.com/rjpcasalino/pie>
