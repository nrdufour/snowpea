# SnowPea

Managing raspberry pi (3 & 4) via nixos flakes.
(Maybe, I will add Orange Pi 5 plus to it if doable...)

The goals are:

+ produce a generic sdcard image to be able to properly boot (done)
+ produce any sdcard image that would be dedicated to a give purpose
+ help with deploy remotely (via remote nixos-rebuild)

Thanks for the general inspiration coming from <https://github.com/rjpcasalino/pie>, and <https://github.com/bjw-s/nix-config> for the remote-rebuild.sh script.
